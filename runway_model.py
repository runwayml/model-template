# This example contains the minimum specifications and requirements
# to port a machine learning model to Runway.

# For more instructions on how to port a model to Runway, see the Runway Model
# SDK docs at https://sdk.runwayml.com

# RUNWAY
# www.runwayml.com
# hello@runwayml.com

# =========================================================================

# Import the Runway SDK. Please install it first with
# `pip install runway-python`.
import runway
from runway.data_types import number, text, image
from example_model import ExampleModel

# Setup the model, initialize weights, set the configs of the model, etc.
# Every model will have a different set of configurations and requirements.
# Check https://docs.runwayapp.ai/#/python-sdk to see a complete list of
# supported configs. The setup function should return the model ready to be
# used.

# Every model needs to have at least one command. Every command allows to send
# inputs and process outputs. To see a complete list of supported inputs and
# outputs data types: https://sdk.runwayml.com/en/latest/data_types.html

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # run the model server using the default network interface and ports,
    # displayed here for convenience
    runway.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8000)

## Now that the model is running, open a new terminal and give it a command to
## generate an image. It will respond with a base64 encoded URI
# curl \
#   -H "content-type: application/json" \
#   -d '{ "caption": "red" }' \
#   localhost:8000/generate
